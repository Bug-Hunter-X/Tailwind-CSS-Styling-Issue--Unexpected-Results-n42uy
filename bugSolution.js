// Check your Tailwind CSS configuration file (tailwind.config.js) to ensure that the required classes are defined and that the configuration is correct.
// Check for CSS conflicts. If another CSS rule has a higher specificity than the Tailwind CSS class, it will override the Tailwind CSS class.
// Use the !important flag as a last resort to override other CSS rules.
// Inspect the element in your browser's developer tools to see which CSS rules are being applied.
