```javascript
// Some code that uses Tailwind CSS classes
<div class="bg-gray-100 p-4">
  <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold">This is a heading</h1>
  <p class="text-gray-700">This is some text.</p>
</div>
```
This code might produce an unexpected result if the Tailwind CSS configuration is incorrect or if there's a conflict with other CSS rules. For example, if the `bg-gray-100` class isn't defined in the Tailwind configuration, the background color won't be applied. Similarly, if another CSS rule has a higher specificity and overrides the Tailwind classes, the styling might not be as expected.
